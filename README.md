# async-chat-redis-docker-django

This repo is an asynchronous simple chat, built in with Django, Nginx, Redis, Daphne and Postgresql using Docker.
This chat is the same chat in the channels tutorial mentioned in the [channels document](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html), but with additional configuration with Redis, Nginx and Postgresql composed together with Docker.
